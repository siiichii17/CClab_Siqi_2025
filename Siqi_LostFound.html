            This playground sat at the bottom of a hill that I would always bike, skate, or scooter down. The large black gates opened up into a set of swings. Black, rubber, with a fence along the side of it, almost tempting me to try and jump over it with the momentum from the swing. The park had a sprinkler in the middle, where I would run around on hot summer days. The park designers had built a gutter from the sprinklers that ran all the way through the park to the sand pit. The sand pit was deep, and had reliefs carved into the sides of wild animals and beasts. I would jump in and out of the sand pit and run to the see saws to play with my brother. The light would scatter across the entire playground during sunset, shadows cast from all the jungle gyms and fences. At times it felt very geometric, but my favorite obstacle in the entire park, was the carousel. That circle would spin and spin and spin and I would feel like I was in a spaceship or UFO, flying off to another world.
