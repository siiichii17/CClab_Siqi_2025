        <p class="para-right">
          2024 has been a very challenging year for me, a relentless juggling between the demands of academia and pursuing my dream of graduate school. In these moments of emotional turbulence, I found I couldn't stop eating when I was in a negative emotion, which means I am eating not because I feel hungry but because I need a source of solace and comfort. Even when my brain receives signals of satiety, my mind still needs the fleeting happiness of eating, but I know it’s very unhealthy. I discovered through extensive research that this behavior is not unique to me. It has a name called: "Emotional Eating." It is a phenomenon where food transcends its role as mere sustenance and becomes a coping mechanism to navigate the complex maze of stress and emotions. My goal is to find an alternative way to digest people‘s negative emotions. Users will gradually release their negative emotions by interacting with the visual effects designed on the web art page (p5). These visual elements and interactive mechanisms attract users' attention and allow them to vent their feelings. Additionally, I drew inspiration from the classic game, which already exists, so I tried to add my design and build my own game.
