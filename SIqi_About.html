<section class="border"></section>

<p>
	Welcome to my profile. My CC Lab projects explore creative coding and visual computation through seven core works: Lost & Found, Face Generator, Exquisite Corpse, Optical Illusion, Experimental Clock, Data Portrait, and Autobiographical Game. These projects combine generative design, interaction, animation, and personal narrative to investigate form, time, data, and storytelling through code.

<h3><span>I</span></h3>	
<h4><span>AM</span></h4>	

<p1>I received my Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design from the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Design and Technology at Parsons School of Design. My practice focuses on observing everyday life and transforming real moments into thoughtful visual and interactive design.

<p2>
   I am a graphic and interaction design student from China with a strong passion for art and creative technology. I have studied drawing and painting for over seven years since childhood, which has built a solid foundation in color, composition, and visual expression. I chose to pursue my undergraduate studies in graphic design abroad, where I developed a deeper understanding of visual communication and digital design. Through my CC Lab practice, I explored creative coding, generative design, interactivity, data visualization, and experimental digital media. These experiences allowed me to move beyond static graphics and create interactive, time-based, and system-driven works. My current design practice focuses on combining visual design with interaction to translate everyday life into meaningful visual and interactive experiences.
